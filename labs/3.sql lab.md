**1.**   **Using a subquery, display the product names and product ID numbers from the Production.Product table that have been ordered.**

```sql
SELECT ProductID, Name 
FROM Production.Product 
WHERE ProductID IN (SELECT ProductID FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail);
```



**2.**   **Change the query written in question 1 to display the products that have not been ordered.**

```sql
SELECT ProductID, Name 
FROM Production.Product 
WHERE ProductID NOT IN (
SELECT ProductID FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail 
    WHERE ProductID IS NOT NULL);
```

FROM Person.Person
UNION
SELECT HireDate 
FROM HumanResources.Employee;

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.testOrderDetail( 
    OrderID INT NOT NULL, 
    ItemID INT NOT NULL, 
    Price Money NOT NULL,

```

**7.**   **Create a view called dbo.vw_Products that displays a list of the products from the Production.Product table joined to the Production.ProductCostHistory table.

```sql
CREATE VIEW dbo.vw_Products AS (

    SELECT C.CustomerID, 
    YEAR(OrderDate) AS OrderYear, 
    MONTH(OrderDate) AS OrderMonth, 
    SUM(TotalDue) AS TotalSales

CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fn_RemoveNumbers (@Expression VARCHAR(250))

RETURNS VARCHAR(250) AS 

BEGIN

DECLARE @NewExpression VARCHAR(250) = '';

DECLARE @Count INT = 1;

DECLARE @Char CHAR(1);

WHILE @Count <= LEN(@Expression) 

BEGIN

SET @Char = SUBSTRING(@Expression,@Count,1);

IF ISNUMERIC(@Char) = 0 

BEGIN

SET @NewExpression += @Char;

END

**13.** **Create a stored procedure called dbo.usp_CustomerTotals that displays the total sales from the TotalDue column per year and month for each customerTest the stored procedure.**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.usp_CustomerTotals AS
 SELECT C.CustomerID, YEAR(OrderDate) AS OrderYear,
 MONTH(OrderDate) AS OrderMonth, SUM(TotalDue) AS TotalSales
 FROM Sales.Customer AS C

 INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH
