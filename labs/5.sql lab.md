**1.**   **Join the Sales.SalesOrderHeader table to the Sales.SalesOrderDetail table. Display the SalesOrderID, OrderDate, and ProductID columns in the results. The Sales.SalesOrderDetail table should be inside the derived table query.**

```sql
SELECT SOH.SalesOrderID, SOH.OrderDate, ProductID

FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH

INNER JOIN (

 SELECT SalesOrderID, ProductID

 FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail) AS SOD

 ON SOH.SalesOrderID = SOD.SalesOrderID;
```

 

**2.**   **Rewrite the query in question 1 with a common table expression**

```sql
 WITH SOD AS (

 SELECT SalesOrderID, ProductID

 FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail

 )

SELECT SOH.SalesOrderID, SOH.OrderDate, ProductID

FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH

INNER JOIN SOD ON SOH.SalesOrderID = SOD.SalesOrderID;
```



**3.**   **Write a query that displays all customers along with the orders placed in 2001. Use a common table expression to write the query and include the CustomerID, SalesOrderID, and OrderDatecolumns in the results.**

```sql
WITH SOH AS (

 SELECT SalesOrderID, OrderDate, CustomerID

 FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader

 WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1/1/2001' AND '12/31/2001'

 )

SELECT C.CustomerID, SalesOrderID, OrderDate

FROM Sales.Customer AS C

LEFT OUTER JOIN SOH ON C.CustomerID = SOH.CustomerID**;**
```



**4.**   **Write a query that joins the HumanResources.Employee table to the Person.Person table so that you can display the FirstName, LastName, and HireDate columns for each employee. Display the JobTitle along with a count of employees for the title. Use a derived table to solve this query.**

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, e.JobTitle, HireDate, CountOfTitle

FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e

INNER JOIN Person.Person AS p ON e.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID

INNER JOIN (

 SELECT COUNT(*) AS CountOfTitle, JobTitle

 FROM HumanResources.Employee

 GROUP BY JobTitle) AS j ON e.JobTitle = j.JobTitle;
```



**5.**   **Rewrite the previous query using CTE.**

```sql
WITH j AS

 (SELECT COUNT(*) AS CountOfTitle, JobTitle

 FROM HumanResources.Employee

 GROUP BY JobTitle)

SELECT FirstName, LastName, e.JobTitle, HireDate, CountOfTitle

FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e

INNER JOIN Person.Person AS p ON e.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID

INNER JOIN j ON e.JobTitle = j.JobTitle;
```



**6.**   **Display the CustomerID, SalesOrderID, and OrderDate for each Sales.SalesOrderHeader row as long as the customer has placed at least five orders.**

```sql
WITH c AS (

 SELECT CustomerID

 FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader

 GROUP BY CustomerID

 HAVING COUNT(*) > 4)

SELECT c.CustomerID, SalesOrderID, OrderDate

FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH

INNER JOIN c ON SOH.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;

--derived table

SELECT c.CustomerID, SalesOrderID, OrderDate FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH INNER JOIN (

 SELECT CustomerID

 FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader

 GROUP BY CustomerID

 HAVING COUNT(*) > 4) AS c ON SOH.CustomerID = c.CustomerID**;**
```

 

**7.**   **Create a temp table called #CustomerInfo that contains CustomerID, FirstName, and LastNamecolumns. Include CountOfSales and SumOfTotalDue columns. Populate the table with a query using the Sales.Customer, Person.Person, and Sales.SalesOrderHeader tables.**

```sql
CREATE TABLE #CustomerInfo( CustomerID INT, FirstName VARCHAR(50),

LastName VARCHAR(50),CountOfSales INT, SumOfTotalDue MONEY);

GO


INSERT INTO #CustomerInfo(CustomerID,FirstName,LastName, CountOfSales, SumOfTotalDue)


SELECT C.CustomerID, FirstName, LastName,COUNT(*),SUM(TotalDue) FROM Sales.Customer AS C INNER JOIN Person.Person AS P ON C.CustomerID = P.BusinessEntityID INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH ON C.CustomerID = SOH.CustomerID GROUP BY C.CustomerID, FirstName, LastName ;
```



**8.**   **Change the previous code written to use a table variable instead of a temp table.**

```sql
DECLARE @CustomerInfo TABLE ( CustomerID INT, FirstName VARCHAR(50),

LastName VARCHAR(50),CountOfSales INT, SumOfTotalDue MONEY);

 

INSERT INTO @CustomerInfo(CustomerID,FirstName,LastName, CountOfSales, SumOfTotalDue)

 

SELECT C.CustomerID, FirstName, LastName,COUNT(*),SUM(TotalDue) FROM Sales.Customer AS C INNER JOIN Person.Person AS P ON C.CustomerID = P.BusinessEntityID INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH ON C.CustomerID = SOH.CustomerID GROUP BY C.CustomerID, FirstName, LastName ; 

 
```
