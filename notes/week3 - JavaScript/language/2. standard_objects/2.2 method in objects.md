### Object Constructors

```html
<script>
// Constructor function for Person objects
function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eye;
}

// Create a Person object
let myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");

// Display age
// .innerHTML method is used to change the html contents of a DOM object
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =   
"My father is " + myFather.age + "."; 
</script>
```



### "this" keyword

- Methods can reference the object as `this`.
  - when `this` in a class, it is the same as Java
  - when `this` in a function. it's the calling scope
- The value of `this` is defined at run-time.
- arrow functions are special: they have no `this`.

```javascript
function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref: this
  };
}

let user = makeUser();

alert( user.ref.name ); // What's the result?

//Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```

 `this` do not look at object definition. Only the moment of call matters.

Here the value of `this` inside `makeUser()` is `undefined`, because it is called as a function, not as a method with “dot” syntax.

==To Fix==

```javascript
function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref() {
      return this;
    }
  };
}

let user = makeUser();

alert( user.ref().name ); // John
```



### Method shorthand

```javascript
// these objects do the same

user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function()"
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```
