# Page Redirection

scenario:

you clicked a URL to reach a page X but internally you were directed to another page Y. It happens due to **page redirection**. This concept is different from [JavaScript Page Refresh](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/javascript_page_refresh.htm).

reasons:

- We did not like the name of your domain and you are moving to a new one. 
- We have built-up various pages based on browser versions or their names or may be based on different countries, then instead of using your server-side page redirection, you can use client-side page redirection to land your users on the appropriate page.
