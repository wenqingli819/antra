### What is SPA?

##### old time:

browser                                                       web server

​					 --send request -->  

​					<-- (always) get a new page back --



##### SPA:

browser                                                       web server

first time come to the website, browser downloads a little program in js and run it

you don't need to reload the page anymore

it will communicate to the server over the internet and get the information you need without reloading the page.
