### Assembly

**Assembly is** a basic building block of . Net Framework applications. It **is** basically compiled code that can be executed by the CLR

An **assembly is** a collection of types and resources that **are** built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality. An Assembly can be a DLL or exe depending upon the project that we choose.

### assembly language vs bytecode

**Bytecode** is similar to **assembly language** in that it is not a high-level **language**, but it is still somewhat readable, unlike machine **language**. ... The primary **difference** between the two is that **bytecode** is generated for a virtual machine (software), while **assembly language** is created for a CPU (hardware).
