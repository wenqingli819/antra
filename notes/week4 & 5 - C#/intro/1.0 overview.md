# .NET

### Benefits of .NET Platform

##### Languages

c#, Visual Basic, F#

##### Cross Platforms

.NET Core (runs anywhere!)

##### One consistent API

**.NET Standard** is a base set of APIs that are common to all .NET implementations.



### Building blocks of .NET â€“ CLR, CTS, CLS

#### CLR (Common Language Runtime)

- .NET provides a **runtime environment** and a comprehensive **base class library**. The runtime layer is properly referred to as the Common Language Runtime, or CLR. 
- The primary role of the CLR is to locate, load, and manage .NET objects on your behalf. The CLR also takes care of a number of low-level details such as 
  - **memory management**
  - application hosting
  - coordinating threads
  - Performing
  - security checks 

#### CTS (Common Language Specification)

Defines a subset of common types and programming constructs that all .NET programming languages can agree on.

#### Base Class Lib

.NET platform provides a base class library that is available to all .NET programming languages. Not only does this base class library encapsulate various primitives such as threads, file input/output (I/O), graphical rendering systems, and interaction with various external hardware devices, but it also provides support for a number of services required by most real-world applications.

- Common Language Runtime is the execution engine

  - it compiles common intermediate language into native code

  - handles garbage collection

  - enforces code access security

### What is Process?

- when start a program in Windows, the executable (exe file, for example) will be loaded into RAM. Windows will then add the new process to its internal process list and make sure the process receives some CPU time as well as memory and other resources.



### EXE VS DLL

| EXE                                | DLL                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| executable files                   | dynamic link library                                         |
| run independently                  | used by other applications                                   |
| defines an entry point             | -                                                            |
| -                                  | can be reused by other applications                          |
| separate process and memory space. | share the same process and memory space of the calling application |
