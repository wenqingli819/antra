## Null Conditional Operator

allows for null values to be detected more elegantly

Traditionally, dealing with null values requires making an explicit check, which can become tedious.

The null conditional operator makes this process simpler and more concise,

```c#
public ViewResult Index() {
    List<string> results = new List<string>();
    foreach (Product p in Product.GetProducts()) {
        
        string name = p?.Name;//object in the array and the value of the properties could be null
        decimal? price = p?.Price;
        
        // ?: If p is null, then name will be set to null as well. If p is not null, then name will be set to the value of the Person.Name property. 
        
        
        results.Add(string.Format("Name: {0}, Price: {1}", name, price));
    }
    return View(results);
}
```

he null conditional operator can be applied to each part of a chain of properties, like this:

```c#
string relatedName = p?.Related?.Name;
```

#### `??` null coalescing operator

```c#
foreach (Product p in Product.GetProducts()) {
	string name = p?.Name ?? "<No Name>";
    decimal? price = p?.Price ?? 0;
    string relatedName = p?.Related?.Name ?? "<None>";
    results.Add(string.Format("Name: {0}, Price: {1}, Related: {2}",name, price, relatedName));
}
```

```c#
// y = x, unless x is null, in which case y = -1.
int y = x ?? -1;


// Assign i to return value of method, unless
// return value is null, in which case assign
// default value of int to i.
int i = GetNullableInt() ?? default(int);
```

# Operators

`nameof`

`sizeof`



# Control Flow

```c#
object o = "3";
int j = 4;
if (o is int i)
{
  WriteLine($"{i} x {j} = {i * j}");
}
else
{
  WriteLine("o is not an int so it cannot multiply!");
}
```



### `foreach`

```c#
string[] names = { "Adam", "Barry", "Charlie" };
foreach (string name in names)
{
  WriteLine($"{name} has {name.Length} characters.");
}
```

how foreach works internally?

Technically, the `foreach` statement will work on any type that follows these rules:

1. The type must have a method named `GetEnumerator` that returns an object.
2. The returned object must have a property named `Current` and a method named `MoveNext`.
3. The `MoveNext` method must return `true` if there are more items to enumerate through or `false` if there are no more items.

```c#
IEnumerator e = names.GetEnumerator();
while (e.MoveNext())
{
  string name = (string)e.Current; // Current is read-only!
  WriteLine($"{name} has {name.Length} characters.");
}
```

Due to the use of an iterator, the variable declared in a `foreach` statement cannot be used to modify the value of the current item, meaning cannot modify it in the loop and also reading the value.

### `switch`

```c#
message = s switch
{
  FileStream writeableFile when s.CanWrite 
    => "The stream is a file that I can write to.",
  FileStream readOnlyFile 
    => "The stream is a read-only file.",
  MemoryStream ms
    => "The stream is a memory address.",
  null
    => "The stream is null.",
  _ 
    => "The stream is some other type."
};
WriteLine(message);
```



### `Switch` and `goto`

```c#
A_label:
var number = (new Random()).Next(1, 7);
WriteLine($"My random number is {number}");

switch (number)
{
  case 1:
    WriteLine("One");
    break; // jumps to end of switch statement 
  case 2:
    WriteLine("Two");
    goto case 1;
  case 3:
  case 4:
    WriteLine("Three or four");
    goto case 1;
  case 5:
    // go to sleep for half a second
    System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500);
    goto A_label;
  default:
    WriteLine("Default"); 
    break;
} // end of switch statement
```

==note:== You can use the `goto` keyword to jump to another case or a label. use it sparingly. 少用



### `do`...`while`...

```c#
string password = string.Empty;
do
{
  Write("Enter your password: ");
  password = ReadLine();
}
while (password != "Pa$$w0rd");
WriteLine("Correct!");
```
