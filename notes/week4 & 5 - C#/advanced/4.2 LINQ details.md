Behind the scenes `foreach` loops actually call the `IEnumerator` interface with its `MoveNext()` method.



the compiler translates yield iterators into classes that implement the `IEnumerator` interface.



### How are LINQ operators, such as `where`, actually implemented?

- `Where`, `Select`, and all the other LINQ operators are extension methods. 

- they are declared in the `System.Linq` namespace, in a class called `Enumerable`
- In other words, it is a static class that contains a long list of extension methods, one for each of the LINQ operators, plus numerous overloads of these methods.

==create our own **`Where` Operator=**==

- the purpose of `Where` is to filter a sequence.

- it takes an input sequence and a predicate, and returns another sequence

  ```c#
  suppose we want to create a Where LINQ operator by ourselves 
  the purpose of where is to filter a sequence
  
  
  @input: TSource, predicate
  @output: a sequence of IQueryable of data type TSource 
  		//wouldn't the first one be enough?	 // what is behind the where? --<TSource>
  										// generic method
  public static IQueryable<TSource> Where<TSource>(
        this IQueryable<TSource> source,
        Expression<Func<TSource, bool>> predicate)
  
  
  we are adding the extension method(Where) to IQueryable<TSource>, TSource belongs to or impelemnts the IQeryable interface
  two inputs parameters:
  - one is the input sequence
  - another is the delegate (predicate). delegate, meaning the function or method can be passed as a @param
  	the predicate has an input TSource and output bool. 
  	we will get the result with those values in TSource which have a true output based on the condition
  ```
  
  

```c#
namespace WhereTests
{
    public static class MyExtensions
    {
        // Where method is an extension method of IEnumerable<T> interface
        public static IEnumerable<T> Where<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source,
            Func<T, bool> predicate)//delegate takes value of type T and returns a bool
        {
            // he loop pull one item out at a time, then pass it to the predicate
            foreach (var item in source)
            {
                if (predicate(item))     //compare 1 to 3
                {
                    yield return item; //  if true is returned, the item is yield returned.
                }
            }
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        public static IEnumerable<int> GetList()
        {
            var length = 6;
            for (int i = 1; i <= length; i++)
            {
                yield return i;
            }
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var list = GetList();
            var query = list.Where(num => num < 3).Select(num => num);
            foreach (var item in query) //1,
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }
        }
    }
}
```





**`IEnumerable<T>` Supports All the LINQ Operators**

- a lightweight interface with one method, which you can implement with a simple `yield` iterator

### EXPRESSION TREES

| LINQ to Objects                                              | LINQ to SQL                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| the data that is being queried is local and is stored in objects that support the `IEnumerable<T>` interface. | the data is stored in a different process, which is likely to be running on a different machine. And the data structures in a relational database know nothing about `IEnumerable<T>`. |
|                                                              | an expression tree can convert a LINQ to SQL query expression into a data structure, parse that data structure, and compose a SQL statement based on its contents. It can then use conventional techniques to execute that SQL statement and return the results to the developer. |

Questions:

• How do we translate a query expression into a SQL statement that can be sent to a server?

• How do we convert the data we get back from the SQL server into objects that LINQ can query?



Expression trees allow you to convert code into data. a query expression -->  a data structure
