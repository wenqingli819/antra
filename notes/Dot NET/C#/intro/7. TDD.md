# Unit Test

### Writing unit tests

A well-written unit test will have three parts:

- **Arrange**: This part will declare and instantiate variables for input and output.
- **Act**: This part will execute the unit that you are testing. In our case, that means calling the method that we want to test.
- **Assert**: This part will make one or more assertions about the output. An assertion is a belief that, if not true, indicates a failed test. For example, when adding 2 and 2, we would expect the result to be 4.

```c#
using Packt;
using Xunit;
namespace CalculatorLibUnitTests
{
  public class CalculatorUnitTests
  {
    [Fact]
    public void TestAdding2And2()
    {
      // arrange 
      double a = 2;
      double b = 2;
      double expected = 4;
      var calc = new Calculator();
      // act
      double actual = calc.Add(a, b);
      // assert 
      Assert.Equal(expected, actual);
    }
  }
}
```
