## Interface

Interface defines a contract to connect different types together to make new things. 

- no variable, no constructor, cannot be instantiated, support multiple inheritance

  

### Using Default Implementations in Interfaces

```c#
public interface IProductSelection {        IEnumerable<Product> Products { get; }    }
```



### Common interfaces

| Interface          | Method(s)                                              | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `IComparable`      | `CompareTo(other)`                                     | This defines a comparison method that a type implements to order or sort its instances. |
| `IComparer`        | `Compare (first, second)`                              | This defines a comparison method that a secondary type implements to order or sort instances of a primary type. |
| `IDisposable`      | `Dispose()`                                            | This defines a disposal method to release unmanaged resources more efficiently than waiting for a finalizer. |
| `IFormattable`     | `ToString (format, culture)`                           | This defines a culture-aware method to format the value of an object into a string representation. |
| `IFormatter`       | `Serialize (stream, object)` and `Deserialize(stream)` | This defines methods to convert an object to and from a stream of bytes for storage or transfer. |
| `IFormat Provider` | `GetFormat(type)`                                      | This defines a method to format inputs based on a language and region. |



### Comparing objects when sorting

`Arrays.sort(simpleArray);`

##### `IComparable`

```c#
public class Person : IComparable<Person>{
    public int CompareTo(Person other) 
{ 
  return Name.CompareTo(other.Name); 
}
}
```



### Comparing objects using a separate class

Sometimes, you won't have access to the source code for a type, and it might not implement the `IComparable` interface. Use` IComparer`

```c#
using System.Collections.Generic; 
namespace Packt.Shared 
{ 
  public class PersonComparer : IComparer<Person> 
  { 
    public int Compare(Person x, Person y) 
    { 
      // Compare the Name lengths...
      int result = x.Name.Length
        .CompareTo(y.Name.Length);
      // ...if they are equal... 
      if (result == 0) 
      { 
        // ...then compare by the Names...
        return x.Name.CompareTo(y.Name); 
      } 
      else 
      { 
        // ...otherwise compare by the lengths.
        return result; 
      } 
    } 
  } 
}


// Main
WriteLine("Use PersonComparer's IComparer implementation to sort:"); 
Array.Sort(people, new PersonComparer()); 
foreach (var person in people) 
{ 
  WriteLine($"  {person.Name}");
}
```



## Inheritance

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/knowing-when-to-use-override-and-new-keywords

You should almost always prefer to use virtual+override.

`new` is used to prevent unwanted methods from the base class.

They act different!!



#### Upcast And Downcast

*A child class can always refer to its parent class but the parent class can't refer to its child class."*

Downcast - going from top to bottom, i.e, from Super class to Sub class.

```c#
Parent parent = new Child();   
Child child = (Child) parent;
```

Upcast - child going upwards to the parent class.

```c#
Child child = new Child();  
Parent parent = (Parent) child; //Upcasting with an explicit cast  
Parent parent = child; // Upcasting with no explicit cast.  
parent.work(); // Parent class work method will run. Because we know that a child can always refer to parent class.
```



## Generics

```c#
using System;
namespace Packt.Shared
{
    // T implements IComparable,
    // so it must have a method named CompareTo that returns 0 if two objects are equal. 
  public class GenericThing<T> where T : IComparable
  {
    public T Data = default(T);
    public string Process(T input)
    {
      if (Data.CompareTo(input) == 0)      //here
      {
        return "Data and input are the same.";
      }
      else
      {
        return "Data and input are NOT the same.";
      }
    }
  }
}


//Main
var gt1 = new GenericThing<int>();
gt1.Data = 42;
WriteLine($"GenericThing with an integer: {gt1.Process(42)}"); // same
var gt2 = new GenericThing<string>();
gt2.Data = "apple";
WriteLine($"GenericThing with a string: {gt2.Process("apple")}"); //same
```
