# OOP

## Concept

- **Encapsulation** 

- **Composition** 
  - what an object is made of. 
  - For example, a car is composed of different parts, such as four wheels, several seats, and an engine.
  
- **Aggregation** 
  - what can be combined with an object. 
  - a person is not part of a car object, but they could sit in the driver's seat and then becomes the car's driverâ€”two separate objects that are aggregated together to form a new component.
  
- **Inheritance** 
  
  - Base `Exception` , derived `SqlException`
  
  - Base `Payment`, derived `bank`, `Paypal`
  
  - Base `Employee`, derived `PartTimeEmpee` , `FullTimeEmpee`

- **Abstraction** 

  **Abstract Class/ Abstract Method**

  | Abstract Class                                               | Abstract Method              |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
  | can have constructor, variables, but cannot be instantiated, meaning cannot `new` using its constructor | is by default virtual method |
  | Abstract class must be inherited and its abstract methods must be implement by derived class |                              |

  - abstract class example: `BaseCustomer` , derived `Customer` `Visitor`

  ##### Factory Design Pattern

  https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/factory-method-design-pattern-in-c-sharp/

  ```c#
   public interface IVehicle
   {
  
   }
   public class Unicycle : IVehicle
   {
  
   }
   public class Car : IVehicle
   {
  
   }
   public class Motorbike : IVehicle
   {
  
   }
   public class Truck : IVehicle
   {
  
   } 
  
  //VechicleFactory.cs 
   public static class VehicleFactory
      {
          public static IVehicle Build(int numberOfWheels)
          {
              switch (numberOfWheels)
              {
                  case 1:
                      return new UniCycle();
                  case 2:
                  case 3:
                      return new Motorbike();
                  case 4:
                      return new Car();
                  default :
                      return new Truck();
  
              }
          }
      }
  
  //Main
  class Program
  {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
          Console.WriteLine("Enter a number of wheels between 1 and 12 to build a vehicle and press enter");
  
          var wheels = Console.ReadLine();
          var vehicle = VehicleFactory.Build(Convert.ToInt32(wheels));
          Console.WriteLine($" You built a {vehicle.GetType().Name}");
          Console.Read();
      }
  }
  ```

  

- **Polymorphism** 

  1. [**Overloading**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/function-overloading-csharp/)
  2. [**Overriding**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/function-overriding-csharp/)
  3. [**Hiding**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/function-hiding-csharp/)



## Class

Contents of Class

```c#
class C {
	... fields, constants ...   	// for object-oriented programming
	... methods ...
	... constructors, destructors ... 

	... properties ...	// for component-based programming
	... events ...

	... indexers ...	// for convenience
	... overloaded operators ...

	... nested types (classes, interfaces, structs, enums, delegates) ... 
	}

```



### Fields

- ##### **Static Fields**

  ```c#
    public class BankAccount
    {
      public string AccountName; // instance member
      public decimal Balance; // instance member
      public static decimal InterestRate; // shared member
    }
  ```

  Each instance of `BankAccount` will have its own `AccountName` and `Balance` values, but all instances will share a single `InterestRate` value.

- ##### **constant**

  - data never change
  - the compiler copies the data into any code that reads it
  - Examples:  `System.Int32.MaxValue` and `System.Math.PI`

  ```c#
  // constants
  public const string Species = "Homo Sapien";
  ```

  ==Note==

  Constants should be avoided for two important reasons: 

  1. the value must be known at compile time, and it must be expressible as a literal string, Boolean, or number value. 
  2. Every reference to the `const` field is replaced with the literal value at compile time, which will, therefore, not be reflected if the value changes in a future version and you do not recompile any assemblies that reference it to get the new value.

- ##### **read-only**

  A better choice for fields that should not change.

  Every reference to the field is a live reference, so any future changes will be correctly reflected by calling code.

  - The data cannot change after the class is instantiated
  - but the data can be calculated or loaded from an external source at the time of instantiation.

  ```c#
  // read-only fields
  public readonly string HomePlanet = "Earth";
  ```

- ##### Setting fields with default literals

  ```c#
  namespace Packt.Shared
  {
    public class ThingOfDefaults
    {
      public int Population; 
      public DateTime When; 
      public string Name;
      public List<Person> People;
      public ThingOfDefaults()
      {
        Population = default(int); // C# 2.0 and later 
        When = default(DateTime);
        Name = default(string);
        People = default(List<Person>);
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  

- ##### **event**
  
  - The data references one or more methods that you want to execute when something happens, such as clicking on a button, or responding to a request from other code. 



### Methods

- ##### **Constructor**

- ##### **Property** = smart fields

  - The statements execute when you get or set data.

  ```c#
  private string favoritePrimaryColor;
  public string FavoritePrimaryColor
  {
    get
    {
      return favoritePrimaryColor;
    }
    set
    {
      switch (value.ToLower())
      {
        case "red":
        case "green":
        case "blue":
          favoritePrimaryColor = value;
          break;
        default:
          throw new System.ArgumentException(
            $"{value} is not a primary color. " + 
            "Choose from: red, green, blue.");
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```c#
  class Employee
      {
          private int age;
          public int Id { get; set; }
          public string FullName { get; set; }
          public int Age
          {
              get
              {
                  return age;
              }
              set
              {
                  age = value;
                  if (age < 18 || age > 56)
                      throw new AgeException(18, 56);
              }
          }
      }
  ```

  

- **indexer** 



#### Method Return Types

Method return types:

- single type

  - string ...

- complex type: 

  - person ...

- collection type: 

  - List\<Person> ...

- ==Tuple==

  An efficient way to combine two or more values into a single unit.

  Suppose we have a method  `GetTheData` that returns **BOTH** a `string` value and an `int` value. We can return an instance of that complex type

  ```c#
  public class TextAndNumber
  {
    public string Text;
    public int Number;
  }
  public class Processor
  {
    public TextAndNumber GetTheData()    // can return class, but tuple is better
    {
      return new TextAndNumber
      {
        Text = "What's the meaning of life?",
        Number = 42
      };
    }
  }
  ```

   .NET added a new `System.ValueTuple` type that is more efficient in some common scenarios than the old .NET 4.0 `System.Tuple` type.

  ```c#
  public (string, int) GetFruit()
  {
    return ("Apples", 5);
  }
  
  // In Main method:
  (string, int) fruit = bob.GetFruit();
  WriteLine($"{fruit.Item1}, {fruit.Item2} there are.");
  ```

##### Naming the fields of a tuple

```c#
// Person class
public (string Name, int Number) GetNamedFruit()
{
  return (Name: "Apples", Number: 5);
}


//Main method
var fruitNamed = bob.GetNamedFruit();
WriteLine($"There are {fruitNamed.Number} {fruitNamed.Name}.");
```

##### Inferring tuple names

```c#
var thing1 = ("Neville", 4);
WriteLine($"{thing1.Item1} has {thing1.Item2} children.");
var thing2 = (bob.Name, bob.Children.Count);
WriteLine($"{thing2.Name} has {thing2.Count} children.");
```

##### deconstruct tuples into separate variables

```c#
// store return value in a tuple variable with two fields
(string name, int age) tupleWithNamedFields = GetPerson();
// tupleWithNamedFields.name
// tupleWithNamedFields.age
// deconstruct return value into two separate variables
(string name, int age) = GetPerson();
// name
// age


//Main method
(string fruitName, int fruitNumber) = bob.GetFruit();
WriteLine($"Deconstructed: {fruitName}, {fruitNumber}");
```



### Sealed Class

- A sealed class cannot be inherited.

- It is not permitted to use the abstract modifier with a sealed class



### Partial classes

Partial classes allow us to split a class into two or more files. All these parts are then combined into a single file when application is compiled. Partial keyword can also be used to split a struct or interface into multiple files



### Pattern Matching

[doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/pattern-matching)



### Access Modifiers

| ==`private`==                                                | `internal`                                                   | ==`protected`==                                              | `internal protected`                                         | `private protected`                                          | public |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Member is accessible inside the type only. This is the default. | Member is accessible inside the type and any type in the same assembly. | Member is accessible inside the type and any type that inherits from the type. | Member is accessible inside the type, any type in the same assembly, and any type that inherits from the type. Equivalent to a fictional access modifier named `internal_or_protected`. | Member is accessible inside the type or any type that inherits from the type and is in the same assembly. Equivalent to a fictional access modifier named `internal_and_protected`. This combination is only available with C# 7.2 or later. |        |





### Overriding Members

##### `virtual` 

base class that has methods and properties marked as `virtual`, they can be overridden.

```c#
// overridden methods 
public override string ToString() 
{ 
  return $"{Name} is a {base.ToString()}"; 
}
```



### Preventing inheritance and overriding

```c#
public sealed class ScroogeMcDuck
{
}
```
