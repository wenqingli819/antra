# LINQ

- LINQ stands for **Language Integrated Query**
- **System.Linq** namespace
- common query syntax which allows us to write structured type-safe queries over local object collections and remote data sources. 

  

### Basic units of **data in LINQ**

​					    |								

​					**Sequences**   (any object that implements the generic IEnumerable)

​		- **local sequence** (local collection of objects in memory) 

​        - remote sequence (**remote data source** such as SQL server). These sequences additionally implement the IQueryable<> interface and are supported through a matching set of standard query operators in the [Queryable class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.queryable?view=net-5.0).

​						|

​					**Elements** (each element is each item in the sequence)



**Query Operator** is a method that transforms a sequence. There are 50 query operators





### Basic  Syntax

```c#
from elem in collection
where...
orderby ...
select...  //ends with select or group clause
  
foreach...
  
  
names.Where(n=> n.Contains("a"))
  	 .OrderBy(n=> n.Length)
     .Select(n=> n.ToUpper())
```



### Query Expressions

### LINQ Examples

```c#
// find teenager students
Student[] teenAgerStudents = studentArray
    						.Where(s => s.age > 12 && s.age < 20)
    						.ToArray();
       
// find first student whose name is Bill 
Student bill = studentArray
    			.Where(s => s.StudentName == "Bill")
    			.FirstOrDefault();
        
var query = names
  .Where(name => name.Length > 4)
  .OrderBy(name => name.Length)   // first sort by length
  .ThenBy(name => name);     // then sort by alphabetical order

```



### LINQ Architecture

![image-20210319102005447](../../../../resources/image-20210319102005447.png)

#### LINQ Providers

- LINQ provider is a software component that lies between the LINQ queries and the actual data source. 
- It  implements the **IQueryProvider** and **IQueryable** interface for a particular data source and will convert the LINQ queries into a format that can be understood by the underlying data source.



### Different Ways to Write LINQ Query with Examples

- Linq Query Syntax 

  ```c#
  from object in datasource // initialization
  where condition     // condition
  select object       // selection
  ```

- Linq Method Syntax (most popular and uses a lambda expression)

  ```c#
  DataSource.ConditionMethod().SelectionMethod()
  ```

- Mixed Syntax (Query + Method)

  ```c#
  (from object in DataSource 
  where condition
  select object).Method()
  ```

  

### LINQ has 3 parts:

1. Data Source (in-memory objects, SQL, XML)
2. Query
   1. Initialization (to work with a particular data source)
   2. Condition (where, filter, sorting condition)
   3. Selection (single selection, group selection or joining)
3. Execution of the query

- **Extension methods (REQUIRED)**: These include examples such as `Where`, `OrderBy`, and `Select`. These are what provide the functionality of LINQ.      

- **LINQ providers (REQUIRED)**: These include LINQ to Objects, LINQ to Entities, LINQ to XML, LINQ to OData, and LINQ to Amazon. These are what convert standard LINQ operations into specific commands for different types of data.      

- **Lambda expressions (optional):** These can be used instead of named methods to simplify LINQ extension method calls.      

- **LINQ query comprehension syntax (optional):** These include `from`, `in`, `where`, `orderby`, `descending`, and `select`. These are C# keywords that are aliases for some of the LINQ extension methods, and their use can simplify the queries you write, especially if you already have experience with other query languages, such as Structured Query Language (SQL).



## IEnumerable and IQueryable in C#

### `IEnumerable`

##### What's IEnumerable?

`IEnumerable<T>` is an interface that guarantees a given class is **iterable**.

Array, and all generic collections, such as `List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, Stack<T>`, and `Queue<T>`, implement `IEnumerable<T>` can be queried and manipulated with LINQ. They all  implement the `IEnumerable<T>` class.

<img src="https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/c-users-pranaya-pictures-generic-ienumerable-inte.png" alt="c-users-pranaya-pictures-generic-ienumerable-inte" style="zoom:60%;" />

`Enumerable` defines more than 45 extension methods:

| Method(s)                                                    | Description                                                  | return type |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `First`, `FirstOrDefault`, `Last`, `LastOrDefault`           | Gets the first or last item in the sequence or throws an exception, or returns the default value for the type, for example, 0 for an `int` and `null` for a reference type, if there is no first or last item. |             |
| `Where`                                                      | Returns a sequence of items that match a specified filter.   | bool        |
| `Single`, `SingleOrDefault`                                  | Returns an item that matches a specific filter or throws an exception, or returns the default value for the type, if there is not exactly one match. |             |
| `ElementAt`, `ElementAtOrDefault`                            | Returns an item at a specified index position or throws an exception, or returns the default value for the type, if there is not an item at that position. |             |
| `Select`, `SelectMany`                                       | Projects items into a different shape, that is, type, and flattens a nested hierarchy of items. |             |
| `OrderBy`, `OrderByDescending`, `ThenBy`, `ThenByDescending` | Sorts items by a specified property.                         |             |
| `Reverse`                                                    | Reverses the order of items.                                 |             |
| `GroupBy`, `GroupJoin`, `Join`                               | Group and join sequences.                                    |             |
| `Skip`, `SkipWhile`                                          | Skips a number of items or skips while an expression is true. |             |
| `Take`, `TakeWhile`                                          | Take a number of items or take while an expression is true.  |             |
| `Aggregate`, `Average`, `Count, LongCount`, `Max`, `Min`, `Sum` | Calculates aggregate values.                                 |             |
| `All`, `Any`, `Contains`                                     | Returns true if all or any of the items match the filter, or if the sequence contains a specified item. |             |
| `Cast`                                                       | Converts items into a specified type.                        |             |
| `OfType`                                                     | Removes items that do not match a specified type.            |             |
| `Except`, `Intersect`, `Union`                               | Performs operations that return sets. Sets cannot have duplicate items. Although the inputs of these methods can be any sequence and so can have duplicates, the result is always a set. |             |
| `Append`, `Concat`, `Prepend`                                | Performs sequence-combining operations.                      |             |
| `Zip`                                                        | Performs a match operation on two sequences based on the position of items, for example, the item at position 1 in the first sequence matches the item at position 1 in the second sequence. |             |
| `Distinct`                                                   | Removes duplicate items from the sequence.                   |             |
| `ToArray`, `ToList`, `ToDictionary`, `ToLookup`              | Converts the sequence into an array or collection.           |             |



### `IQueryable`

##### What is IQueryable in C#?

A simple interface with only 1 method: enable for each loop on a given object

<img src="../../../../resources/image-20210320105551319.png" alt="image-20210320105551319" style="zoom: 50%;" />

 **IQueryable** is an interface and it is available in **System.Linq** namespace.

It is also a child of the IEnumerable interface. So we can store IQuerable in a variable of type IEnumerable. 

`IQueryProvider`

![c-users-pranaya-pictures-iqueryprovider-interface-768x225](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/c-users-pranaya-pictures-iqueryprovider-interface-768x225.png)

The methods provided by the **IQueryProvider** are used to create all Linq Providers. So, this is the best choice for other data providers such as **Linq to SQL, Linq to Entities**, etc.



Diffs between **IEnumerable** & **IQueryable**

| IEnumerable                                             | IQueryable                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| in-memory collections like List, Array, etc             | out-memory such as remote database, service, etc.            |
| mostly used for LINQ to Object and LINQ to XML queries. | mostly used for LINQ to SQL and LINQ to Entities queries.    |
| doesn’t support custom queries.                         | supports custom queries using CreateQuery and Executes methods. |
| doesn’t support lazy loading.                           | supports lazy loading and hence it is suitable for paging like scenarios. |



## Extension Method

```c#
namespace ExtensionMethods
{
    public static class IntExtensions // MUST BE static class
    {
        							// use the extension method on this.int type
        public static bool IsGreaterThan(this int i, int value)
        {
                    return i > value;
        }
    }
}
```

##### Points to Remember :

1. Extension methods can be added to custom, .NET Framework or third party classes, structs or interfaces.
2. The first parameter of the extension method must be of the type for which the extension method is applicable, preceded by the **this** keyword.
3. Extension methods can be used anywhere in the application by including the namespace of the extension method.

##### **When to use Extension Methods in C#?**

You need to use an extension method if any of the following conditions are true:

1. You need a method on an existing type and you are not the owner of the source code of that type.
2. You need a method on an existing type, you do own the source code of that type but that type is an interface.
3. You need a method on an existing type, you do own the source code and that type is not an interface but adding the method creates undesired coupling.



### Forcing Immediate Execution

- ToList,ToArray, ToDictionary, ToLookup 
- Operators that return a single element
  - FirstOrDefault
  - aggregate function (count,max,min,avg)
