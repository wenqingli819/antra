# Async, Await, And Tasks

enable code that reads like a sequence of statements, but executes in a much more complicated order based on external resource allocation and when tasks complete.



Make a breakfast asynchronously:

![synchronous breakfast](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/media/synchronous-breakfast.png)

Computers don't interpret those instructions the same way people do. The computer will block on each statement until the work is complete before moving on to the next statement. 

It would take much longer to create the breakfast, and some items would have gotten cold before being served.

client programs,

-  you want the UI to be responsive to user input. 
-  Your application shouldn't make a phone appear frozen while it's downloading data from the web.

server programs,

- you don't want threads blocked. Those threads could be serving other requests.



### Don't block, await instead

 The `await` keyword provides a non-blocking way to start a task, then continue execution when that task completes.

```c#
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    Coffee cup = PourCoffee();
    Console.WriteLine("coffee is ready");

    Egg eggs = await FryEggsAsync(2);
    Console.WriteLine("eggs are ready");

    Bacon bacon = await FryBaconAsync(3);
    Console.WriteLine("bacon is ready");

    Toast toast = await ToastBreadAsync(2);
    ApplyButter(toast);
    ApplyJam(toast);
    Console.WriteLine("toast is ready");

    Juice oj = PourOJ();
    Console.WriteLine("oj is ready");
    Console.WriteLine("Breakfast is ready!");
}
```

###  Start tasks concurrently

[System.Threading.Tasks.Task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task) 

We could start cooking the eggs, bacon, and toast at the same time. As each requires action, you'd turn your attention to that task, take care of the next action, then await for something else that requires your attention.

We start a task and hold on to the [Task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task) object that represents the work. 

We'll `await` each task before working with its result.

```c#
Coffee cup = PourCoffee();
Console.WriteLine("coffee is ready");

//store the tasks for operations when they start, rather than awaiting them
Task<Egg> eggsTask = FryEggsAsync(2);
Task<Bacon> baconTask = FryBaconAsync(3);
Task<Toast> toastTask = ToastBreadAsync(2);

Toast toast = await toastTask;
ApplyButter(toast);
ApplyJam(toast);
Console.WriteLine("toast is ready");
Juice oj = PourOJ();
Console.WriteLine("oj is ready");

//move the await statements for the bacon and eggs to the end of the method, before serving breakfast
Egg eggs = await eggsTask;
Console.WriteLine("eggs are ready");
Bacon bacon = await baconTask;
Console.WriteLine("bacon is ready");

Console.WriteLine("Breakfast is ready!");
```

The asynchronously prepared breakfast took roughly 20 minutes, this time savings is because some tasks ran concurrently.
