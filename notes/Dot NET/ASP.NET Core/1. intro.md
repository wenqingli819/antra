### What is ASP.NET Core ?

- it consists of a platform for processing HTTP requests, a series of principal frameworks for creating applications, and secondary utility frameworks

- open source and cloud-optimized web framework for developing modern web applications.

- ASP.NET Core apps can run on .NET Core or on the full .NET Framework.

- can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac and Linux.



### Benefits

- A unified story for building web UI and web APIs.
- Architected for testability.
- Razor Pages makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive.
- Ability to develop and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  Open-source and community-focused.
- Integration of modern, client-side frameworks and development workflows.
- A cloud-ready, environment-based configuration system.
  Built-in dependency injection.
- A lightweight, high-performance, and modular HTTP request pipeline.
  Ability to host on IIS, Nginx, Apache, Docker, or self-host in your own process.
- Side-by-side app versioning when targeting .NET Core.
- Tooling that simplifies modern web development.



## Key topics for understanding how to develop ASP.NET Core apps.

### The Startup class

- entry point of the application

- configure the request pipeline (2 methods)

  1. add services to the DI container
  2. configure the HTTP request pipeline. The order matters

#### Dependency Injection (Services)

DI 3 ways

1. constuctor injection (✅)

   readonly type

   only place can change is in constructor  / or field definiition

   if no readonly, someone can change it at anywhere in the code which is not good.

2. method injection

3. property injection



#### Middleware

register the middleware in the **Configure**

middleware => some pieces of code that will be executed in http pipeline to handle **requests,** and core features that the application frameworks depend on, such as **URL routing** and the **Authorization**.

​							middleware can add functionality or remove something

​							if one of the middleware failed.

client http request -> M1 -> M2 -> M3

​                                M1    <-     m2   < -|
