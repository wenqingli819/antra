# Areas

- a structure inside an app

- a way to **partition** an ASP.NET Core Web app **into smaller functional groups**, each with its own set of Razor Pages, controllers, views, and models.

- example:

  e-commerce app with multiple business units, such as **checkout**, **billing**, and **search**. Each of these units have their own area to contain views, controllers, Razor Pages, and models.
