## one-to-one

// maybe optional to have navigation property

TableA   (Customer)

​	TableBID	

​	navigation property

TableB    (CustomerDetail)

​	TableAID

​	navigation property

```c#
// Client - Personal Library one-to-one relationship
modelBuilder.Entity<Client>().HasOne(c=>c.Library).WithOne(l => l.Client).HasForeignKey<PersonalLibrary>(); //we put fk on PersonalLibrary

// Explain:
// Client has one to one relationship with library, WithOne sets the navigation property on the other side on the personal library
// since this is one-to-one relationship, foreignkey can go both ways
```

in one-to-one relationship, which side to put fk?

in general, it is better to put fk on the parent table

- Mandatory relationship

  if fk is mandatory on one side, fk on that side

  if mandatory on both sides or optional on both sides, you can choose on which table you want to create the fk

- Optional relationship

  if the relationship is *optional* on both sides you may decide to implement the foreign key in the table with fewer numbers of rows, as this would save space.

## one-to-many (mostly used)

```c#
TableA    (Movie)
		ICollection<Trailer> Trailers //has a list of TableB



TableB    (Trailer)
		// combination of the below two can form a fk
		TableAID
    	
    	//navigation property 
		Movie Movie //one trailer belongs to one particular movie
```

- by convention 

  if we provide a list of xx, say in author class, we have List\<Book> books, but in the book class, we use a string to represent author

  // then that's done! we can add-migration

### Navigation properties

- provide a way to navigate an association between two entity types.

  

## many-to-many

no conventions, no annotations. can only use FluentAPI

```c#
TableA		(Genre)

	ICollection<Movie> Movies

TableB

TableAID 	(Movies)
    ICollection<Genre> Genres
```

```c#
// craete many-to-many relationship table - MovieGenre
// a movie has many Genres, each Genre has many movies
movieBuilder.Entity<Movie>().HasMany(m => m.Genres).WithMany(g => g.Movies)
                                                        // table name
                .UsingEntity<Dictionary<string, object>>("MovieGenre",
                                                         
                    m => m.HasOne<Genre>().WithMany().HasForeignKey("GenreId"), // table we are referencing, and the fk for that
                    g => g.HasOne<Movie>().WithMany().HasForeignKey("MovieId"));
```

here is another way of creating many-to-many relationship

create `PersonLibraryBook` class

<img src="../../../../resources/image-20210403010844736.png" alt="image-20210403010844736" style="zoom:50%;" />

in `Book`

<img src="../../../../resources/image-20210403011215935.png" alt="image-20210403011215935" style="zoom:50%;" />

in `PersonalLibrary`

<img src="../../../../resources/image-20210403011253111.png" alt="image-20210403011253111" style="zoom:50%;" />

![image-20210403011318190](../../../../resources/image-20210403011318190.png)

```c#
modelBuilder.Entity<PersonalLibraryBook>().HasKey(p1 => new {p1.BookId,p1.LibraryId})
    
// many-to-many
modelBuilder.Entity<PersonalLibraryBook>().HasOne(p1 => p1.Book).WithMany(b=> b.PersonalLibraryBooks).HasForeignKey(p1=> p1.BookId);
modelBuilder.Entity<PersonalLibraryBook>().HasOne(p1 => p1.PersonalLibrary).WithMany(l=> l.PersonalLibraryBooks).HasForeignKey(p1=> p1.LibraryId);
```
