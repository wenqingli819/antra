# Loops

### do...while

```javascript
do {
  // first execute the loop body
} while (condition);   //then check condition
```

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { 
  alert(i);
}
```



### for...in loop

```javascript
for(varName in object){
    statement or block to execute
}
```



### Break and continue

- **break**
  - exit a loop early, breaking out of the enclosing curly braces.
- **continue** 
  - start the next interaction (if the condition allows) and skip the remaining code block.
  - if the condition remains true, then it starts the next iteration, otherwise the control comes out of the loop.



### [Labels for break/continue](https://javascript.info/while-for#labels-for-break-continue)

```javascript
outerloop:      // label name 
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
 innerloop:
  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
  	let input = prompt('Value at coords (${i},${j})', '');

    // if an empty string or canceled, then break out of both loops
    if (!input) break outer; // (*)

    // do something with the value...
  }
}
alert('Done!');
```



### Practice!!!

##### while

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (++i < 5) alert( i ); //1,2,3,4
```

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i++ < 5) alert( i ); //0,1,2,3,4 ❌
//1，2，3，4，5
// i++ increments i and then returns the old value to compare with 5
// alert new i
// 0+1<5 alert(1)
// 1+1<5 alert(2)
// 2+1<5 alert(3)
// 3+1<5 alert(4)
// 4+1<5 alert(5) because i=4 < 5
```



##### for

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
//01234
```

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );
//1234 ❌
//01234
//1. Execute once i = 0 before everything (begin).
//2. Check the condition i < 5
//3. If true – execute the loop body alert(i), and then ++i
```



##### Output even numbers in the loop

Use the `for` loop to output even numbers from `2` to `10`.

```javascript
for(let i = 2; i <=10; i++){
	if(i%2===0){
		alert(i);
	}
}
```

Replace "for" with "while"

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  alert( `number ${i}!` );
}

let i = 0;
while(i<3){
  alert( `number ${i}!` );   
  i++;
}
```



##### Repeat until the input is correct

Question:

Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than `100`. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.

The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than `100` or cancels the input/enters an empty line.

Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.



Rewrite question:

let num = Prompt("enter a num")

**loop** if num<=100

**not loop** if cancel (num is null) || num>100

```javascript
let num;
do {
  num = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100?", 0);
} while (num <= 100 && num);
```



##### Output prime numbers

definition of a prime nunber n:

- n>1 && can only evenly divided by 1 and n
- n=2

**Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from `2` to `n`.**

For `n = 10` the result will be `2,3,5,7`.

> To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer *n* by Eratosthenes' method:
>
> 1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through *n*: (2, 3, 4, ..., *n*).
> 2. Initially, let *p* equal 2, the smallest prime number.
> 3. Enumerate the multiples of *p* by counting in increments of *p* from 2*p* to *n*, and mark them in the list (these will be 2*p*, 3*p*, 4*p*, ...; the *p* itself should not be marked).
> 4. Find the smallest number in the list greater than *p* that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let *p* now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
> 5. When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes below *n*.

```javascript
// pseudocode based on Eratosthenes' method

let n = 10;
let p,i,j;
// create an array and initialize with true values as default
let A = new array[n]; //not sure how js work on arrays 
for p from 2 to n{
  initially all set to true
}  

for i from 2 to square root of n[exclusive]{
  if A[i] is true:
  	for j = i^2, i^2+i, i^2+3i,... not exceeding n
    	A[j] = false
}
return all i such that A[i] is true
```

```javascript
// i will be testing with all numbers(j) that is smaller than i, and whether j can be evenly divided by i or not
// if found j can evenly divided by i => skip the current loop and increment i
// j is from the smallest prime 2 to i-1

// time : O (n ^ 2)
let n = 10;
nextPrime:
for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) { // for each i...

  for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) { // look for a divisor..
    if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime; // not a prime, go next i
  }

  alert( i ); // a prime
}
```

There’s a lot of space to optimize it. For instance, we could look for the divisors from `2` to ==square root of `i`== to avoid redundant counting.
