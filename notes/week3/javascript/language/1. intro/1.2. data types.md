# Data Types 

Eight data types in JavaScript. 

Seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). Then, Object data type.

| primitive                                           | reference                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| stored directly in the location the variable access | accessed by refernece                                        |
| stored on stack                                     | objects stored on the heap. a pointer to a location in memory |

### Primitive data types

#### Number

 	-(253-1)  <number<= (253-1) (9007199254740991) 

  +  special numbers: `Infinity`, `-Infinity` and `NaN`.


#### BigInt

```javascript
// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

#### String

```javascript
// embed an expression
alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); // the result is 3

// the result is ${1 + 2} (double quotes do nothing)
alert( "the result is ${1 + 2}" ); 
```

#### Boolean

#### Null

- The result of `typeof null` is `"object"`. That’s an officially recognized error in `typeof` behavior, coming from the early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. Definitely, `null` is not an object. It is a special value with a separate type of its own.

#### Undefined

#### Symbols(ES6)

- used to create unique identifiers for objects.



### Reference type （Object）

Arrays

Object literals

Functions

Dates

Anything else...



### JS is dynamically typed language

- Same var can hold multiple types

- types are associated with values not vars

- no need to specify types. not like other languages that are statically types (Java, C#, C++)

- The supersets of JS: typescript 

  meaning everything that js has,  typescript have them plus more, and it is static typing.



```javascript
//PRIMITIVE TYPES
//string
const name = "John Doe";

//number
const age = 45;

console.log(typeof age);

//boolean
const hasKids = true;
console.log(typeof age);

//null
const car = null;
console.log(typeof car);

//undefined
let test;
console.log(typeof test);

//symbol
const sym = Symbol();
console.log(typeof sym);


//REFERENCE TYPES - Objects
//array
const hobbies = ['movies', 'music'];

//object literal
const address = {
    city: 'boston',
    state: 'MA'
}

const today = new Date();
console.log(today);
console.log(typeof today);



// no error cause “dynamically typed”
let message = "hello";
message = 123456;
```
