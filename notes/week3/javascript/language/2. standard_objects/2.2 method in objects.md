### "this" keyword

- Methods can reference the object as `this`.
- The value of `this` is defined at run-time.
- arrow functions are special: they have no `this`.

```javascript
function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref: this
  };
}

let user = makeUser();

alert( user.ref.name ); // What's the result?

//Error: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
```

 `this` do not look at object definition. Only the moment of call matters.

Here the value of `this` inside `makeUser()` is `undefined`, because it is called as a function, not as a method with “dot” syntax.

==To Fix==

```javascript
function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref() {
      return this;
    }
  };
}

let user = makeUser();

alert( user.ref().name ); // John
```



### Method shorthand

```javascript
// these objects do the same

user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function()"
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```
