# Events

Events = when the user or the browser manipulates a page.

examples:

1. page loads
2. user clicks a button
3. user press any key
4. closing a window
5. resizing the window
6. etc

Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript coded responses, which cause buttons to close windows, messages to be displayed to users, data to be validated, and virtually any other type of response imaginable.

Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 and every HTML element contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript Code.
