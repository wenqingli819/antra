## Delegate

Delegates  is similar to **Java's Functional** Interfaces 

| java lambda                                                  | C# lambda                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| can be viewed as the implementation of an interface with only one method (called a *functional interface*) | C# lambda can be assigned to a `delegate ` which is a type that encapsulates a method |



### What is Delegates

In C#, a method is a first-class object in the same way a `Class` like `String.class` is a first-class object in Java.

It is a variable of a reference type, which holds a reference of a method.



Another way to look: **function pointers**

A delegate contains the memory address of a method that matches the same signature as the delegate so that it can be called safely with the correct parameter types.

### Syntax

Example of a normal method, and how we call it

```c#
public int MethodIWantToCall(string input)
{
  return input.Length; 
}

int answer = p1.MethodIWantToCall("Frog");
```

Alternatively, we can define a delegate with a matching signature to call the method indirectly.

```c#
//declare the delegate type
delegate int DelegateWithMatchingSignature(string s);

// then create a delegate instance that points to the method
var d = new DelegateWithMatchingSignature(p1.MethodIWantToCall);

// call the delegate, which calls the method
int answer2 = d("Frog");
```



### Use case

- we could use delegates to create a queue of methods that need to be called in order.  (like streamAPI in java?)
-  allow multiple actions to perform in parallel.
-  delegates allow us to implement **events** for sending messages between different objects that do not need to know about each other.



### 3 most popular delegates

| Delegate  | Signature                                                 | Anonymous Method                                             | lambda expression                                            | Input                           | Output                    |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| action    | `public delegate void Print(int val);`                    | `Action<int> printActionDel = delegate(int i)                                 {                                     Console.WriteLine(i);                                 };      printActionDel(10);` | `Action<int> printActionDel = i => Console.WriteLine(i);             printActionDel(10);` | generic. can take 1...16 input  | Void                      |
| predicate | `public delegate bool Predicate<in T>(T obj);`            |                                                              |                                                              | generic. **only 1 input** param | Bool                      |
| Func      | `public delegate TResult Func<in T, out TResult>(T arg);` | `Func<int> getRandomNumber = delegate()                             {                                 Random rnd = new Random();                                 return rnd.Next(1, 100);                             };` | `Func<int, int, int>  Sum  = (x, y) => x + y;`               | generic. can take 1...16 input  | generic. return 1 output. |
