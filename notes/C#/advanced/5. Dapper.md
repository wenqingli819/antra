# Dapper

### What is Dapper?

.NET **ORMs** (Object Relational Mapper) include:

- Entity Framework
- NHibernate
- LINQ to sql

**Micro ORM - Dapper**

- maps database and .NET objects

- small, lightweight, fewer features

- created by stackoverflow to increase the page load time

- it extends the **IDbConnection** by providing useful extension methods to query the database：

  - `Execute`
  - `ExecuteReader`
  - `ExecuteScalar`
  - `Query`

  First, Single & Default

  | Result                 |  No Item  | One Item | Many Items |
  | :--------------------- | :-------: | :------: | :--------: |
  | `QueryFirst`           | Exception |   Item   | First Item |
  | `QuerySingle`          | Exception |   Item   | Exception  |
  | `QueryFirstOrDefault`  |  Default  |   Item   | First Item |
  | `QuerySingleOrDefault` |  Default  |   Item   | Exception  |

  - `QueryMultiple`

### The hierarchy

interface **IDbConnection** 

​			|

abstract class **DBConnection**: IDbConnection, **IDisposable**

​			|               																\

class SqlConnection												     	Dispose()

##### Dispose()

When we have unmanaged code, garbage collector can not remove that object. To remove the object, need to use Dispose() in the IDisposable interface.

Example of unmanaged code: SqlConnection

| Managed Code                                                 | Unmanaged Code                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A code which is written to aimed to get the services of the managed runtime environment execution like **[CLR(Common Language Runtime)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/common-language-runtime-clr-in-c-sharp/)** in [.NET Framework](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-net-framework/). | A code which is directly executed by the operating system.   |
| It always implemented by the managed runtime environment instead of directly executed by the operating system. | It always aimed for the processor architecture and depends upon computer architecture. Whenever you want to execute the same code for the different architecture you have to recompile that code again according to that architecture. |
| The managed runtime environment provides different types of services like garbage collection, type checking, exception handling, bounds checking, etc | In unmanaged code, the memory allocation, type safety, security, etc are **managed by the developer**. |



### Why Dapper?

- It is very efficient and owns the title of King of Micro ORM in terms of performance.
- perform CRUD operations directly using IDBConnection object.
- provide querying static and dynamic data over database.

| ORM (Entity Framework)                                       | Micro ORM (Dapper)                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| It provides the full solution, hence take more time to process. | Fast performance (where LINQ to SQL was too slow) |
| use if there are many complex queries                        | use if the query logic is simple.                 |



### How Dapper works?

3 steps

1. Create an IDbConection object
2. Write a query to perform CRUD operations
3. Pass query as parameter in Execute method



## Dapper Methods

### Execute

This method is usually used to execute:

- [Stored Procedure](https://dapper-tutorial.net/execute#example---execute-stored-procedure)
- [INSERT statement](https://dapper-tutorial.net/execute#example---execute-insert)
- [UPDATE statement](https://dapper-tutorial.net/execute#example---execute-update)
- [DELETE statement](https://dapper-tutorial.net/execute#example---execute-delete)

#####  Execute - INSERT(Single)

```c#
public int Insert(Dept item){
  using (var connection = new SqlConnection(DbHelper.ConnectionString))
  {
      return connection.Execute("insert into Dept values (@DName, @Loc)", item);
  }
}
```



### Query

`Query` can execute a query and map the result.

##### The result can be mapped to:

- [Anonymous](https://dapper-tutorial.net/query#example---query-anonymous)
- [Strongly Typed](https://dapper-tutorial.net/query#example---query-strongly-typed)
- [Multi-Mapping (One to One)](https://dapper-tutorial.net/query#example---query-multi-mapping-one-to-one)
- [Multi-Mapping (One to Many)](https://dapper-tutorial.net/query#example---query-multi-mapping-one-to-many)
- [Multi-Type](https://dapper-tutorial.net/query#example---query-multi-type)



##### Example - Query Multi-Mapping (One to One)

```c#
public IEnumerable<Employee> GetAllWithDept(){
  string sql = "Select e.Id, e.Ename, e.Salary, e.DeptId, d.Id, d.DName, d.Loc from  Employee e inner join Dept d on e.DeptId = d.Id"; 
  using (var connection = new SqlConnection(DbHelper.ConnectionString))
  {
      return connection.Query<Employee, Dept, Employee>(
        sql,(e,d) => {e.Dept = d; 
                      return e;}
      );
  }
}
```



##### Example - Query Multi-Mapping (One to Many)

```c#
string sql = "INSERT INTO Customers (Customer) values (@CustomerName);";
using(var connection = new SqlConnection(DbHelper.ConnectionString))
```
