In Bootstrap, there are some components like Dropdowns, Alerts, Carousel, Modal

These are not pure CSS, HTML components, they depend on some 3rd party libraries such as jQuery, Propper...

When we installed bootstrap, in our MVC project we had jQuery, but in Angular, we don't want to mix jQuery and Angular in one project.

We have 2 Angular 3rd party libraries:

- ng-bootstrap Dropdowns, Alerts, Carousel, Modal using regular Angular without jQuery
- ngx-bootstrap
