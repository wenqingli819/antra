This enables a Web page to do partial update without disrupting what the user is doing.

- JQuery.Ajax

- Angular => HttpClient    **
- ...

Components can use HttpClient to talk with API to get JSON data

Services, DI, HttpClient to talk to API

### Decorators

Modules, components and services are classes that use *decorators*,  provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.

- `@Component()`
- `@Directive()`
- `@Pipe()`
- `@Injectable()`
- `@NgModule()`
