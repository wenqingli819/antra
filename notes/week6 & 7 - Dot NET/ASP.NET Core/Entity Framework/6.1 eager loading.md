## Eager loading

 `Include` 

```c#
using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
    var blogs = context.Blogs
        .Include(blog => blog.Posts)
        .ToList();
}
```

```c#
// include data from multiple relationships
using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
    var blogs = context.Blogs
        .Include(blog => blog.Posts)
        .Include(blog => blog.Owner)
        .ToList();
}
```

Eager loading a collection navigation in a single query may cause performance issues. For more information, see [Single vs. split queries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/single-split-queries).

#### Including multiple levels of related data

`ThenInclude`

include multiple levels of related data using the `ThenInclude` method. 

```c#
using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
    var blogs = context.Blogs       //from blogs
        .Include(blog => blog.Posts)   //include all related Posts
        .ThenInclude(post => post.Author)   //theninclude the author of each Post 
        .ToList();
}


//include multiple levels and multiple roots in the same query
using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
    var blogs = context.Blogs // when query Blogs
        .Include(blog => blog.Posts)      //include Posts
        .ThenInclude(post => post.Author)  //then inlcude Author,Tags of the Posts(need to do this seperate!)
        .Include(blog => blog.Posts)   //include Posts
        .ThenInclude(post => post.Tags)   // then include Tags
        .ToList();
}
```



### Filtered include

using `NoTracking` queries when results of Filtered Includ unexpected data due to [navigation fixup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/tracking).

All relevant entities that have been queried for previously and have been stored in the Change Tracker will be present in the results of Filtered Include query, even if they don't meet the requirements of the filter. 

```c#
var orders = context.Orders.Where(o => o.Id > 1000).ToList();

// customer entities will have references to all orders where Id > 1000, rather than > 5000
var filtered = context.Customers.Include(c => c.Orders.Where(o => o.Id > 5000)).ToList();
```
