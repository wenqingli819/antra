# ASP.NET Core 

### What is ASP.NET Core ?

- it consists of a platform for processing HTTP requests, a series of principal frameworks for creating applications, and secondary utility frameworks

- open source and cloud-optimized web framework for developing modern web applications.

- ASP.NET Core apps can run on .NET Core or on the full .NET Framework.

- can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac and Linux.



### Benefits

- A unified story for building web UI and web APIs.
- Architected for testability.
- Razor Pages makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive.
- Ability to develop and run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  Open-source and community-focused.
- Integration of modern, client-side frameworks and development workflows.
- A cloud-ready, environment-based configuration system.
  Built-in dependency injection.
- A lightweight, high-performance, and modular HTTP request pipeline.
  Ability to host on IIS, Nginx, Apache, Docker, or self-host in your own process.
- Side-by-side app versioning when targeting .NET Core.
- Tooling that simplifies modern web development.



## Key topics for understanding how to develop ASP.NET Core apps.

### The Startup class

- entry point of the application

- configure the request pipeline (2 methods)

  1. add services to the DI container
  2. configure the HTTP request pipeline. The order matters

#### Dependency Injection (Services)

DI 3 ways

1. constuctor injection (âœ…)

   readonly type

   only place can change is in constructor  / or field definiition

   if no readonly, someone can change it at anywhere in the code which is not good.

2. method injection

3. property injection



#### Middleware

small pieces of the application attached to the application pipeline, that handle requests and responses:

- Chooses whether to pass the request to the next component in the pipeline.

- Can perform work before and after the next component in the pipeline.

go through a set of middleware    (built-in middlewares)

#### The Host

- The host is responsible for **app startup** and **lifetime management**. At a minimum, the host configures a server and a request processing pipeline. 

- create a host environment for logging, dependency injection, and configuration to work

The purpose of **Generic Host** is to decouple the HTTP pipeline from the Web Host API to enable a wider array of host scenarios. Messaging, background tasks, and other non-HTTP workloads based on Generic Host benefit from cross-cutting capabilities, such as configuration, dependency injection (DI), and logging.

#### Servers



#### Configuration

#### Options

#### Environment



#### Logging

There are different logging providers available as NuGet packages. ASP.NET Core ships with the following providers:

- Console

- Debug

- EventSource

- EventLog

- TraceSource

- Azure App Service 

| **Log  Level** | **Severity** | **Extension  Method** | **Description**                                              |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Trace          | 0            | LogTrace()            | Log  messages only for tracing purpose for the developers    |
| Debug          | 1            | LogDebug()            | Log  messages for short-term debugging purpose               |
| Information    | 2            | LogInformation()      | Log  messages for the flow of the application.               |
| Warning        | 3            | LogWarning()          | Log  messages for abnormal or unexpected events in the application flow. |
| Error          | 4            | LogError()            | Log  error messages.                                         |
| Critical       | 5            | LogCritical()         | Log  messages for the failures that require immediate attention |

#### Routing

In asp.net, there are 2 types of routing

1. traditional routing
2. attribute based routing

{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}



optional route parameter use a question mark(?)<img src="../../../../../../../Desktop/ShareToMac/code-workspace/typora/antra/resources/image-20210408102318045.png" alt="image-20210408102318045" style="zoom: 50%;" />

#### Error Handling

#### Make HTTP requests

#### Content Root

#### Web Root
