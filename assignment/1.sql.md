# Write queries for following scenarios

**Using AdventureWorks Database**

1. Write a query that retrieves the columns ProductID, Name, Color and ListPrice from the Production.Product table, with no filter. 

   ```sql
use AdventureWorks2019
   select ProductID, Name, Color, ListPrice 
   from Production.Product 
   ```

   

2. Write a query that retrieves the columns ProductID, Name, Color and ListPrice from the Production.Product table, the rows that are 0 for the column ListPrice

   ```sql
   select ProductID, Name, Color, ListPrice 
   from Production.Product 
   where ListPrice = 0
   ```

   

3. Write a query that retrieves the columns ProductID, Name, Color and ListPrice from the Production.Product table, the rows that are rows that are NULL for the Color column.

   ```sql
   select ProductID, Name, Color, ListPrice 
   from Production.Product 
   where color is null
   ```

   

4. Write a query that retrieves the columns ProductID, Name, Color and ListPrice from the Production.Product table, the rows that are not NULL for the Color column.

   ```sql
   select ProductID, Name, Color, ListPrice 
   from Production.Product 
   where color is not null
   ```

   

5. Write a query that retrieves the columns ProductID, Name, Color and ListPrice from the Production.Product table, the rows that *are not* NULL for the column Color, and the column ListPrice has a value greater than zero.

   ```sql
   select ProductID, Name, Color, ListPrice 
   from Production.Product 
   where color is not null
   and ListPrice > 0
   ```

   

6. Generate a report that concatenates the columns Name and Color from the Production.Product table by excluding the rows that are null for color.

   ```sql
   select concat(Name, ': ', Color) as 'Name: Color'
   from Production.Product 
   where color is not null
   
   ```

   

7. Write a query that generates the following result set  from Production.Product:

   Name And Color

   \--------------------------------------------------

   NAME: LL Crankarm -- COLOR: Black

   NAME: ML Crankarm -- COLOR: Black

   NAME: HL Crankarm -- COLOR: Black

   NAME: Chainring Bolts -- COLOR: Silver

   NAME: Chainring Nut -- COLOR: Silver

   NAME: Chainring -- COLOR: Black

     ………

   ```sql
   select concat('NAME:',Name, '--', 'COLOR:',Color) as 'Name: Color'
   from Production.Product 
   where color is not null
   ```

   

8. Write a query to retrieve the to the columns ProductID and Name from the Production.Product table filtered by ProductID from 400 to 500

   ```sql
   select ProductID, Name
   from Production.Product 
   where ProductID between 400 and 500
   ```

   

9. Write a query to retrieve columns ProductID, Name and color from the Production.Product table restricted to the colors black and blue

   ```sql
   select ProductID, Name, Color
   from Production.Product 
   where color = 'black' or color = 'blue'
   ```

   

10. Write a query to generate a report on products that begins with the letter S. 

    ```sql
    select Name
    from Production.Product 
    where Name like 'S%'
    ```

    

11. Write a query that retrieves the columns Name and ListPrice from the Production.Product table. Your result set should look something like the following. Order the result set by the Name column. 

     Name                        ListPrice

    -------------------------------------------------- -----------

    Seat Lug                      0,00

    Seat Post                     0,00

    Seat Stays                     0,00

    Seat Tube                     0,00

    Short-Sleeve Classic Jersey, L           53,99

    Short-Sleeve Classic Jersey, M           53,99

    ...

    ```sql
    select Name, ListPrice
    from Production.Product 
    where Name like 'S%'
    order by Name asc
    ```

    

12. Write a query that retrieves the columns Name and ListPrice from the Production.Product table. Your result set should look something like the following. Order the result set by the Name column. The products name should start with either 'A' or 'S'

    Name                        ListPrice

    -------------------------------------------------- ----------

    Adjustable Race                  0,00

    All-Purpose Bike Stand               159,00

    AWC Logo Cap                    8,99

    Seat Lug                      0,00

    Seat Post                     0,00

    ​        ………

    ```sql
    select Name, ListPrice
    from Production.Product 
    where Name like 'A%' 
    or Name like 'S%'
    order by Name asc
    ```

    

13. Write a query so you retrieve rows that have a Name that begins with the letters SPO, but is then *not* followed by the letter K. After this zero or more letters can exists. Order the result set by the *Name* column.

    ```sql
    select Name, ListPrice
    from Production.Product 
    where Name like 'SPO[^k]%' 
    order by Name asc
    ```

    

14. Write a query that retrieves *unique* colors from the table Production.Product. Order the results in descending manner

    ```sql
    select distinct Color
    from Production.Product 
    order by Color desc
    ```

    

15. Write a query that retrieves the unique combination of columns ProductSubcategoryID and Color from the Production.Product table. We do not want any rows that are NULL.in any of the two columns in the result.

    ```sql
    select distinct ProductSubcategoryID, Color
    from Production.Product 
    where ProductSubcategoryID is not null
    and Color is not null
    ```

    

16. Something is “wrong” with the WHERE clause in the following query. 

    We do not want any Red or Black products from any SubCategory that those with the value of 1 in column ProductSubCategoryID, unless they cost between 1000 and 2000.

    Note:

    The LEFT() function will be covered in a forthcoming module.

    ```sql
    -- original version
    SELECT ProductSubCategoryID
        , LEFT([Name],35) AS [Name]
        , Color, ListPrice 
    FROM Production.Product
    WHERE Color IN ('Red','Black') 
       OR ListPrice BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000 
       AND ProductSubCategoryID = 1
    ORDER BY ProductID
    
    -- fixed version
    SELECT ProductSubCategoryID
        , LEFT([Name],35) AS [Name]
        , Color, ListPrice 
    FROM Production.Product
    WHERE Color not IN ('Red','Black') 
    	AND ProductSubCategoryID != 1
       OR ListPrice BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000 
    ORDER BY ProductID
    ```

    

17. Write the query in the editor and execute it. Take a look at the result set and then adjust the query so it delivers the following result set.

    ProductSubCategoryID      Name       Color      ListPrice

    1          Mountain-500 Black, 52       Black      539,99

    ```sql
    -- not sure I understand this question
    SELECT ProductSubCategoryID
    , LEFT([Name],35) AS [Name]
        , Color, ListPrice 
    FROM Production.Product
    WHERE ProductSubCategoryID < 15
    	and Color IN ('Red','Black') 
       OR ListPrice BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000 
    ORDER BY ProductID
    ```
    
    

GOOD LUCK.
