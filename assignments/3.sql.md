# Answer following questions

1. ##### In SQL Server, assuming you can find the result by using both joins and subqueries, which one would you prefer to use and why?

   |             | join                            | subquery                                                     |
   | ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | logic       | -                               | - **logically correct**  `Get facts from A, conditional on facts from B`. In such instances, it makes more logical sense to stick B in a sub-query than to do a join. <br/>- **readability**<br/>- **safer**, you don't have to be cautious about getting duplicated facts from A due to multiple matches against B. |
   | performance | Usually quicker than subqueries | -                                                            |

   

2. ##### What is CTE and when to use it?

   Definition:

   CTE stands for common table expression.  A CTE allows you to define a **temporary view** in the execution scope of a statement such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `MERGE`.

   When to use:

   - **Break up complex queries** such as complex joins and sub-queries

   - Substitute for a view, but doesn't require the overhead, metadata, or persistence of a formal view. 

   - Recursive CTE -  reference/join the same data set multiple times in the same statement.

     

3. ##### What are Table Variables? What is their scope and where are they created in SQL Server?

   ##### Table variable:

   a special type of the local variable that helps to store data temporarily, similar to the temp table in SQL Server.

   It can be used within a Transact-SQL batch, stored procedure, or function.

   ##### Where are they created:

   table variables are stored in the **tempdb** database

   ##### Scope :

   The lifetime of the table variable only lasts for the duration of the batch, function, or stored procedure. As a result, the table variable in SQL Server is automatically dropped at the end of the batch.

4. ##### What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE? Which one will have better performance and why?

   | DELETE                                                       | TRUNCATE                                                     |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | DML (Data Manipulation Language)                             | DDL (Data Definition Language)                               |
   | delete all or specific rows from a table specified using a Where clause<br>When the DELETE statement is executed without WHERE clause it will delete all the rows | removes all rows of a table. We cannot use a Where clause in this. |
   | removes rows one at a time.                                  | removes all rows in a table by deallocating the pages that **are** used to store the table data |
   | In the DELETE command, a tuple is locked before removing it. | While in this command, data page is locked before removing the table data. |
   | logs entry for each deleted row in the transaction log.      | does not log entries for each deleted row in the transaction log. |
   | slower                                                       | faster                                                       |
   | can activate a trigger.                                      | cannot activate a trigger.                                   |
   | can be used with indexed views.                              | cannot be used with indexed views.                           |

   

5. ##### What is Identity column? How does DELETE and TRUNCATE affect it?

   ##### Identity column:

   Auto generated column in a table. Generate key values based on a provided **seed** (starting point) and increment.

   **When DELETE:** not reset the `identity column` but keep on increasing.

   **When TRUNCATE:** resets the identity value to the original seed value of the table.

   

6. ##### What is difference between “delete from table_name” and “truncate table table_name”?

   Truncate always remove all the rows from a table whereas delete from table_name can delete all rows or delete specified rows followed by the where condition.

   After performing a `DELETE` operation you need to **COMMIT** or **ROLLBACK** the transaction to make the change permanent or to undo it. Note that this operation will cause all DELETE triggers on the table to fire.
   
   `TRUNCATE` removes all rows from a table. The operation cannot be rolled back and no triggers will be fired. As such, TRUCATE is faster and doesn't use as much undo space as a DELETE.
   
   

# Write queries for following scenarios

All scenarios are based on Database NORTHWND.

1. List all cities that have both Employees and Customers.

   ```sql
   -- output:Kirkland,London,Seattle
   
   -- using join
   select distinct e.City
   from Employees e
   join Customers c
   on e.City = c.City
   
   -- using subquery
   select distinct e.City 
   from Employees e
   where e.City in (select City from Customers)
   ```

   

2. List all cities that have Customers but no Employee.
   a.	Use sub-query
   b.	Do not use sub-query

   ```sql
--a.subquery. 66 records
   select distinct c.City 
   from Customers c
   where c.City not in (select City 
                     from Employees e)
   --b.no subquery, using join. 66 records
      select distinct c.City 
      from Customers c
      left join Employees e
      on c.City = e.City
      where e.city is null
   
   --c.no subquery, using except
   select distinct city from Customers  
   except 
   select distinct city from Employees
   ```



3. List all products and their total order quantities throughout all orders.

   ```sql
   select ProductID, sum(Quantity)as 'Total Orders'
   from [Order Details]
   group by ProductID
   ```

   

4. List all Customer Cities and total products ordered by that city.

   ```sql
   select c.City, sum(od.Quantity)as 'Total Orders'
   from Customers c
   join Orders o
   on c.customerid = o.CustomerID
   join [Order Details] od 
   on o.OrderID = od.OrderID
   group by c.City
   ```

   

5. List all Customer Cities that have at least two customers.
   a.	Use union
   b.	Use sub-query and no union

   ```sql
-- ouput:10 cities
   --a.union
   
   --b.sub-query 
select distinct c.City
   from Customers c
   where city in (select city 
   			from Customers 
   			group by city 
   			having 1<count(CustomerID))
   ```
   
   
   
6. List all Customer Cities that have ordered at least 2 different kinds of products.

   ```sql
   --69 cities
   select distinct c.City
   from Customers c
   where city in (select ShipCity 
                   from Orders o 
   				join [Order Details] od
   				on o.OrderID = od.OrderID
   				group by ShipCity
   				having count(ProductID) > 1)
   ```

   

7. List all Customers who have ordered products, but have the ‘ship city’ on the order different from their own customer cities.

   ```sql
   select distinct c.CustomerID, c.City, o.ShipCity 
   from Customers c
   join Orders o
   on c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
   where c.city != o.ShipCity
   ```

8. ==(review)== List 5 most popular products, their average price, and the customer city that ordered most quantity of it.

   top 5 most popular products

   ​    avg price

   ​    customer city that ordered most quantity of it

   ```sql
   select top 5 ProductID, AVG(UnitPrice) as AvgPrice,
          (select top 1 City  -- most quantity
   	   from Customers c 
   	   join Orders o 
   	   on o.CustomerID=c.CustomerID 
   	   join [Order Details] od2 
   	   on od2.OrderID=o.OrderID 
   	   where od2.ProductID=od1.ProductID 
   	   group by city 
   	   order by SUM(Quantity) desc) as City 
   from [Order Details] od1
   group by ProductID 
   order by sum(Quantity) desc
   ```

   

9. List all cities that have never ordered something but we have employees there.
   a.	Use sub-query
   b.	Do not use sub-query

   > rephrase the question:
   >
   > list all customer cities that are not in order.ShipCity
   >
   > and city is in Employees.city
   ```sql
   -- a.Use sub-query
   select distinct City 
   from Employees 
   where city not in (select ShipCity from Orders where ShipCity is not null)
   
   --b.Do not use sub-query
   select distinct City 
   from Employees 
   where City is not null 
   except (select ShipCity from Orders where ShipCity is not null)
   ```
   
   
   
10. ==(review)==List one city, if exists, that is the city from where the employee sold most orders (not the product quantity) is, and also the city of most total quantity of products ordered from. (tip: join  sub-query)

    > rephrase the question:
    >
    > find city:
    >
    > ​	employee sold most orderIDs
    >
    > ​    &&
    >
    > ​    most total quantity of products

    ```sql
    select (select top 1 City 
            from Orders o 
            join [Order Details] od 
            on o.OrderID=od.OrderID 
            join Employees e 
            on e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
            group by e.EmployeeID,e.City
            order by COUNT(*) desc) as MostOrderedCity,
    
            (select top 1 City from Orders o 
            join [Order Details] od 
            on o.OrderID=od.OrderID 
            join Employees e 
            on e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
            group by e.EmployeeID,e.City
            order by sum(Quantity) desc) as MostQunatitySoldCity
    ```

    

11. How do you remove the duplicates record of a table?

    There are multiple ways.
    1. use group by and count(*), if count(*)>1 then delete the rows using sub query
    2. write a cte that uses ROW_NUMBER() to find the duplicate rows in the specified columns. Then DELETE FROM cte to delete all the duplicate rows but keeps only one occurrence of each duplicate group.

    e.g., 
    Table:  contact_id, first_name, last_name, email

    ```sql
    OR
    
    WITH cte AS (
        SELECT 
            contact_id, 
            first_name, 
            last_name, 
            email, 
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
                PARTITION BY 
                    first_name, 
                    last_name, 
                    email
                ORDER BY 
                    first_name, 
                    last_name, 
                    email
            ) row_num
         FROM 
            sales.contacts
    )
    DELETE FROM cte
    WHERE row_num > 1;
    
    ```
    
    example table:

12. Sample table to be used for solutions below- 

    Employee ( empid integer, mgrid integer, deptid integer, salary integer) 

    Dept (deptid integer, deptname text)
    Find employees who do not manage anybody.

    ```sql
    -- mgrid does not have this employeeid
    
    select e1.empid 
    from Employee e1
    left join Employee e2
    on e1.empid = e2.mgrid
    where e2.mgrid is null
    
    -- OR
    
    select empid from Employee 
    except 
    select mgrid from Employee
    ```

    

13. ==(review)==Find departments that have maximum number of employees. (solution should consider scenario having more than 1 departments that have maximum number of employees). Result should only have - deptname, count of employees sorted by deptname.

    ```sql
    select dt.deptname
    from (select d.deptname, count(e.empid) as totalEMP,
           dense_rank() OVER (ORDER BY count(e.empid) DESC)as rnk
            from Dept d
            join Employee e
            on d.deptid = e.deptid
            group by d.deptname)dt
    where dt.rnk = 1
    
    -- OR
    select deptid 
    from mployee 
    group by deptid 
    having count(*) = (select top 1 count(*) 
    from employee 
    group by deptid 
    order by count(*) desc)
    ```

    

14. Find top 3 employees (salary based) in every department. Result should have deptname, empid, salary sorted by deptname and then employee with high to low salary.

    ```sql
    select top 3 deptname,empid,salary 
    from employee e 
    join dep d 
    on e.deptid=d.deptid 
    order by salary,deptname,empid desc
    ```

    

GOOD  LUCK.
