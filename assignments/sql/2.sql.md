# Answer following questions

1. ##### What is a result set?

   A result set is the output of a query. It could result in a one row, one column output or a 100+ column, million+ row output. Either way that’s a result set. We can have multiple result sets from a single object (stored procedure, function etc) call.

   There are three options.

   - **RESULT SETS UNDEFINED** – This is the default and means that you don’t know what the result set will be.
   - **RESULT SETS NONE** – You expect (and require) that there will be no result set(s) returned.
   - **RESULT SETS ( <result_sets_definition> )** – There will be result set(s) returned and you are going to specify the definition. The column names within the definition(s) can act as alias’ for the column names.

   What use is this?

   To protect your code from changes in the code that it’s calling.

2. ##### Diff between Union and Union All?

   | UNION                                                        | UNION ALL                                                    |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | remove duplicates                                            | -                                                            |
   | Slow. Because need to find and remove duplicate records      | Fast                                                         |
   | sort by first column                                         | -                                                            |
   | SELECT column_list FROM table1<br/>UNION<br/>SELECT column_list FROM table2; | SELECT column_list FROM table1<br/>UNION ALL<br/>SELECT column_list FROM table2; |

   

3. ##### What are the other Set Operators SQL Server has?

   four **set operators** (union, union all, intersect and except) in SQL Server.

   basic rules:

   - The number and the order of the columns must be the same in all queries.
   - The data types must be compatible.

   Returns distinct rows by comparing the results of two queries.

   `except` - returns any distinct values from the query left of the `EXCEPT` operator that aren't also found on the right query.

   ```sql
   -- Use AdventureWorks

   SELECT ProductID
   FROM Production.WorkOrder
   EXCEPT
   SELECT ProductID
   FROM Production.Product ;
   --Result: 0 Rows (work orders without products)
   ```

   `intersect` -  returns any distinct values that are returned by both the query on the left and right sides of the `INTERSECT` operator.

   ```sql
   -- Uses AdventureWorks

   SELECT ProductID
   FROM Production.Product
   INTERSECT
   SELECT ProductID
   FROM Production.WorkOrder ;
   --Result: 238 Rows (products that have work orders)
   ```



4. ##### Diff between Union and Join?

   |                                   | Union    | Join                                                         |
   | --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **combine data in which way?**    | vertical | horizontal                                                   |
   | **number of columns & data type** | same     | can be different. but must have a matched condition between two tables. |



5. ##### Diff between INNER JOIN and FULL JOIN?

   | INNER JOIN                                                 | FULL JOIN                                                    |
   | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | return data from two tables based on the matched condition | return all the data from two tables, no matter they match or not |

6. ##### Diff between left join and outer join

   **left join**:

   - left join = left outer join

   - = based on the condition,

        select matching records from both tables + non matching records from the left table

   **outer join:**

   can be further divided into three sub-categories:

   - left outer join = left join
   - right outer join = right join
   - full outer join = full join

7. ##### What is cross join?

   Cartesian product from 2 tables

   For example, A table has 3 rows, B table has 2 rows, the result set would be  3*2 = 6 rows

8. ##### Diff between WHERE clause and HAVING clause?

   | Diffs                   | WHERE                                                        | HAVING                          |
   | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
   | **code structure**      | select from **where** group by                               | select from group by **having** |
   | **aggregate function?** | The **where** clause works on row’s data, not on aggregated data. but we can use subquery | can work on aggregated data     |



9. ##### Can there be multiple group by columns?

   We can group by multiple columns.

   e.g., group by  column1, column2, ..



# Write queries for following scenarios

1. How many products can you find in the Production.Product table?

   group by shelf, ProductID
   order by Shelf
   ```

11. List the members (rows) and average list price in the Production.Product table. This should be grouped independently over the Color and the Class column. Exclude the rows where Color or Class are null.

    Color            Class  TheCount      AvgPrice

    ```sql
        select color, class, count(*)TheCount, avg(ListPrice)
